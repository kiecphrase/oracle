                    There are 4 distinct seasons; fall, winter, spring, and summer.
                </p>

                <p class="bloc-text">
                    Fall is the harvest season, and considered the start of the new year by most. The end of the harvests are generally met with a celebration, and colder weather. First snow is fairly common in the earlier parts of fall, as the temperature 
                    cools quite quickly. Towards the later months of fall, it is quite common to need snow shoes as the snow easily reaches depths of a full human.
               
                <p class="bloc-text">
                    Winter is a cold time, but also a time for merriment. Most wild beasts have hunkered down for a great slumber, so although the snow generally reaches the tops of houses, there is plenty to do. Temperatures are quite low, generally well below iceform,
                    but that does not stop most from participating in ice-fishing and sledding. Mid winter is marked by Ei Päiviä, the month of no sun, but Taivas and Kuu generally fill the skies with dancing lights and countless stars to keep those who worry at peace.
                </p>

                <p class="bloc-text">
                    Spring is a time of rapid change. Starting with massive snow and frigid winds, in a few short months the temperatures rise to that of early fall. Storms and flooding are very common in spring, but so are wildflowers and new life. Most herders see spring 
                    as their busiest time of year, and farmers prepare their fields for the growing season. 
                </p>

                <p class="bloc-text">
                    Summer is quite pleasent. Most often the weather is warm enough to only need a tunic. Most also wear a brimmed hat as the sun can be quite intense at the midday. Generally, it does not rain too often, and when it does, it is welcomed. The middle of 
                    summer is marked by Ei Yötä, the month in which it never is night.
                </p>

                    The domain is filled with a veriety of people.  
                </p>

                <p class="bloc-text">
                    Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Orcs, and Halflings have set aside racial differences (mostly) to build fledging civilizations together, carving out a bit of safety in the unforgiving domain. These races all treat eachother as equals, though petty issues can 
                    arise. These diverse groups can be found anywhere in the lowlands and in the foothills. They have build up smaller kingdoms of maybe four or five towns, and they tend to patrol their lands. Most are welcoming towards strangers, as they see diversity as their 
                    greatest strength. Industry and economy are equally diverse, and you can find just about anything if you look.
                </p>

                <p class="bloc-text">
                    Dragonborn are a less common sight, but still easy to find if you know where to look. On the larger foothills and smaller mountains, Dragonborn build their towns into rock as a testiment to their strength. Most dragonborn are either herders or masons. Dragonborn
                    tend to be fairly tribal, and although welcoming of newcommers for their economic potential, Dragonborn seldom let nonDragonborn settle with them.

                <p class="bloc-text">
                    Tiefling are the cursed people of the Great Snake, Maailman Syöjä. Tiefling keep to themselves completely and would rather not meet new people, as that rarely works out well. Not much is known about the Tiefling, but it is known that they reside in the islands
                    off of the southern coast, though noone from the mainland has ever seen the islands to confirm it.

                    The Goblins have been here longer than anyone else. They come from back in the Great Unrest, which deeply shaped their societies. Goblins do not really have posessions, what exists exists for all, and as such they tend to get in trouble when interacting
                    with the other groups. Goblins are fairly nomadic, but also have adapted quite well to the harsh winters. Goblins group up with other Goblins mostly, but generally welcome all. Goblins can be found most anywhere, and their tribes range from a handfull to hundreds,
                    but it is impossible to count as they freely group together and split apart.

                    There are plenty of other groups in the domain, but not much is known about them. They live in the most remote areas, mostly keeping to themselves.
