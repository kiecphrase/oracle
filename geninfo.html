                        Character stats, unless specified by the DM, should be claclulated in the following method. To get a stat-block, roll 4d6, dropping the lowest roll and adding the other three together, 7 times. 
                        From those 7 values, drop 1, and use the remaining 6 as your stat values.

                    <p class= "generic">
                        All DMs reserve the right to change stat-blocks if the average of the stat-block is higher than <span class = "emph">14</span>. Even if the stat-block is rolled infront of the DM so that the player could not have cheated or fudged rolls, the DM still
                        reserves the right to change the stats, with in reason. DMs should try to keep the stat-block averages between <span class = "emph">10 and 14</span>.

                    <p class = "generic">
                        Homebrewed content is a great way to expand on the structures of DnD to give each campaign a unique and personal flair. However, homebrewed content can be unbalanced and potentially derail the story the DM has created.
                        Therefore, homebrewed is decided on an <span class = "emph">individual campaign basis</span>. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "generic">
                        If your DM allows homebrewed content, make sure the content you specifically want to use makes sense in the campaign. Does your homebrewed race make sense in the world? Does your special class have any space in the cultures of the story?
                        Does the special item you want basically make you invincible? The important thing to remember, is when in doubt, <span class = "emph">ask your DM</span>, and remember that it's probably better to ask before the first session so you and the DM have time
                        to find a compromise.

                        If you sign up for a campaign, it is expected that you try and make every session. Obviously, noone can make every session, but if you think it's more likely that you'll only be able to make every other sesseion, you should talk
                        with the DM first to see if that's going to be okay.
                    </p>

                    <p class = "generic">
                        In general, when a campaign is going to start, the DM and players should work together to define a session schedule. If you want to join an already started campagin, expect the already defined schedule to be maintained.
                    </p>

                    <p class = "emph">
                        If you have to miss a session of the campaign, it's okay, and it happens, but you need to make sure you let the DM and the other players know.

                <h3 class = "header">Table Talk</h3>
                <div class = "text-bloc">
                    <p class = "generic">
                        Table Talk can be defined literally as talking while at the table durring a session. However, this section specifically defines table talk as players discussing events of the game outside of the context of the game. Here's an example:
                    </p>
                    <p class="generic">
                        <i>
                            Players are about to start a fight with a high level enemy in a large dark cavern. The party is on either side of the cavern, well outside of quiet speaking range. One of the players can see the enemy and knows that the other half 
                            of the party can't see the enemy and that the enemy would be weak to a fireball spell. Because of that, the player tells the other player where to cast, but not in game.
                        </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="generic">
                        This kind of table talk, although beneficial to the party in the short-term, is distructive to the overall session and gameplay. There is nothing wrong with strategizing before a fight, but by "pausing" the game, the immersion is broken.
                        DMs are will within their rights to call out players for table talking, and should feel comfortable removing players that they feel abuse table talking.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>

                <h3 class = "header">Rollplaying</h3>
                <div class = "text-bloc">
                    <p class ="generic">
                        Being able to immerse yourself into the DnD session is one of the greatest draws to playing DnD. Players should feel welcomed and encouraged to role-play as their character. All other players, and the DM, should respect the interpretations 
                        of each player and how they choose to role-play. However, role-playing does not give the player a free pass on shitty behavior. Role-playing your character should not come at the expense of other players or the DM feeling safe and welcome in the
                        space. If a player's role-playing makes anyone uncomfortable, the DM should be informed and address the issues with the problem-player. <span class="emph">If this behavior continues, the DM is well within their rights to remove the player from the remainder
                        of the session or campaign.</span>
